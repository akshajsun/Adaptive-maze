# 🌀 Adaptive Maze Game

A **smart, clean, browser-based puzzle game** featuring **RL-powered procedural maze generation** and **dynamic difficulty adaptation** — built with **JavaScript** and **HTML5 Canvas**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Adaptive Maze Game** challenges you to navigate auto-generated mazes whose complexity evolves with your skill.  
Using **Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning)**, the system adjusts difficulty in real time — keeping gameplay engaging, challenging, and endlessly replayable.

---

## 🎮 Features

- 🤖 **RL-Powered Maze Generation**  
  Built using a recursive maze algorithm, optimized by a Q-learning agent for unique, varied layouts.

- 📈 **Adaptive Difficulty**  
  The maze size and path complexity evolve as you play — easier when you struggle, harder when you excel.

- 💡 **AI Mode**  
  Watch an AI agent solve mazes intelligently, dynamically tuning the game difficulty.

- 🖥️ **Modern UI Design**  
  Minimal, soft panels and grouped progress bars — no neon, just elegant clarity.
